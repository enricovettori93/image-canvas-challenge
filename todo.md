**Improvement**
- Type any
- FTUE to show how it works
- Better UI (maybe)
- Instead of d&d the canvas -> consider the possibility to click 2 times

**Known bugs**
- Need to use two time the "load image" button
- ROIs can be dragged outside the image
- ROIs has some problems if dragged with an overflowing image
